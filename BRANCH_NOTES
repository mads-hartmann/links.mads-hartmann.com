The following works now:

```sh
npm -w packages/lib run build
npm -w packages/cli run build
node packages/cli/dist/index.js
```

TODO:

- Read through the rest of the blog post (document the important parts in this doc)
    - [ ] Go through each tsconfig and package.json to make sure it all looks correct. Document each.
- [x] Upgrade Gitpod config to build the packages as part of the prebuild
- Do I have to manually rebuild everything every time? Can I use ts-node (do I want to?)
    - For rebuilding it sounds like TypeScript project references takes care of that as we're using the `--build` mode "Build mode (see below) will automatically build the referenced project if needed"
    - TODO: Can I use ts-node?
