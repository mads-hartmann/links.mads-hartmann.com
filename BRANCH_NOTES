The following works now:

```sh
npm -w packages/lib run build
npm -w packages/cli run build
node packages/cli/dist/index.js
```

TODO:

- Read through the rest of the blog post
- Upgrade Gitpod config to build the packages as part of the prebuild
- Do I have to manually rebuild everything every time? Can I use ts-node (do I want to?)
